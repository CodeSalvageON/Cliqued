            A somewhat loose-clique made up of people who went to private school in junior-high, just returning in the middle of high school. Few know this clique's place in Burport, but it has much potential.

            Made up of several different friend-groups, the Patel Cluster was once an extremely influential clique, but it's clear that its glory days are over. Faced with growing instability and a drastic decline in influence, the Cluster finds itself becoming a clique only nominally.

          <p class="clique-description">
            Originally a small clique associated with the Patel Cluster, the Lakehouse has quickly grown to overshadow the Cluster and has become one of Burport's most popular cliques. How it will interact with other cliques is yet to be seen.
