            A somewhat loose-clique made up of people who went to private school in junior-high, just returning in the middle of high school. Few know this clique's place in Burport, but it has much potential.

            Made up of several different friend-groups, the Patel Cluster was once an extremely influential clique, but it's clear that its glory days are over. Faced with growing instability and a drastic decline in influence, the Cluster finds itself becoming a clique in name only.

            Originally a small clique associated with the Patel Cluster, the Lakehouse has quickly grown to overshadow the Cluster and has become one of Burport's most popular cliques. How it will interact with other cliques is yet to be seen.

            Perhaps the most well-known clique in Burport, the Waders host constant weekend parties, maintaining immense popularity and influence. However, rumors of tensions between several cliques may threaten their power.

            Stereotypically, the Band Club has always been somewhat of a hub for outcasts. Despite this, the Club also holds some fringes of promise, and what path they will take is anyone's guess.

            Traditionally under the constant influence of the Patel Cluster, the Twin Wrecks have always been something of a mystery, producing useful tools for their puppet masters. However, with the decline of the Cluster, the Twin Wrecks find themselves with a chance to free themselves from being a puppet.

            Usually thought of as a small group of academics associated with the Lakehouse, this clique hardly draws any attention, hence their name. Will this clique use the full potential of their various talents?
